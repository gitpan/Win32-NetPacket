Win32/NetPacket version 0.03
============================

The module Win32::NetPacket provides an Object-Oriented interface
to the Packet Driver API (packet.dll). packet.dll is a part of
WinPcap: the Free Packet Capture Architecture for Windows.

packet.dll offers a set of low level functions to sniff the
network traffic, send packets to the network, obtain the list
of the available network adapters, retrieve various information
about an adapter, ...etc

WinPCap is a software developed by the Politecnico di Torino.

PREREQUISITES

In order to use Win32::NetPacket in your Perls scripts, it is
necessary to install WinPcap on your machine.

* Download WinPcap 3.1:

  http://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm

file: auto-installer (driver +DLLs), and run the executable.

* For the compilation, download the Developer's pack:

  http://www.winpcap.org/devel.htm

(file: wpdpack_3_1.zip) and unzip it in a directory.

* Because the header file Ntddndis.h in the C:\WpdPack\Include directory is 
  out-of-date, it is necessary to replace it by the one contained in a 
  recent SDK or DDK.

INSTALLATION

Edit the Makefile.PL and set $WPCAP to the path of the WPcap
library (default is C:\WpdPack\).

To install the module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   nmake
   nmake test
   nmake install
   
NOTES

* If the compiler prints error messages like that:
  ... error C2079: 'IPAddress' uses undefined struct 'sockaddr_storage'
  ... error C2079: 'SubnetMask' uses undefined struct 'sockaddr_storage'
  ... error C2079: 'Broadcast' uses undefined struct 'sockaddr_storage'
  (typically with VC6.0), your header files are out-of-date.
  Download and install the last platform SDK.

* If some tests of t\04_cst.t fail 
    "#     Failed test (t\04_cst.t at line 25)"
  you are using the old Ntddndis.h file in WpdPack\Include\. 
  Replace it by a new one or, if you have installed the platform SDK, 
  delete it. (The compiler will use the one in the
  C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDK\include\ directory.)
  If you use a old Ntddndis.h file, the module will work, but some 
  OID constants won't be defined.
